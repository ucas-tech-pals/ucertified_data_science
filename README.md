![Screenshot 2025-03-04 110358](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80030f27-e116-404f-a05f-06f450e1f7dd)

## Overview
The **UCertified Data Science** repository is a study case exploring the feasibility and impact of the **UCertified** platform before its implementation. The project aims to statistically support the need for UCertified by analyzing trends in higher education, digital certification, and blockchain-based credentials.

## Objectives
- Assess the demand for university degree certifications with encryption and digital signatures
- Support the **UCertified** idea with data-driven insights and case studies

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Gathering data on certification trends, user needs, and market analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representation of findings using Power BI

## Technologies Used
- **Programming**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing, correlation studies, and market research

## Requirements
To set up the project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucas-tech-pals/ucertified_data_science.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder and run the Jupyter Notebook, and you can find the final dashboard in dashboards folder
